* Prep time: 5 mins
* Cook time: 5 mins
* Total time: 10 mins
* Serves: 6 cups

#### Ingredients: 

* 1 can (360ml) of evaporated coconut milk 
* 1 can (400ml) of coconut cream
* 1 can (430ml) of coconut condensed milk
* 1 cup of white rum (adjust to taste/ preference)
* 1/2 cup plain unsweetened plant milk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* Cinnamon stick (garnish)

#### Method:

Add the ingredients to a blender and blend at a high speed for 1 - 2 minutes until completely combined. Make sure the coconut cream is completely mixed in.

Place in the fridge and chill for an hour before serving. It will thicken as it chills. *tip: If you find it is too think, you can re-blend with more milk before serving or add a little milk to your individual cup.*

Pour in a small glass and serve with a cinnamon stick for a garnish and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
