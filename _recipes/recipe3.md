Jerk seasoning is commonly found in meat dishes in Jamaica but it is used throughout the whole Caribbean. This lunch time dish takes a modern favourite and adds a bit of spice to it. The pulled jackfruit imitates the look and feel of pulled pork, keeping the traditional flavours that go with a jerk dish it freshens it up with a topping of black beans and mango. This will definitely become your lunchtime favourite.
