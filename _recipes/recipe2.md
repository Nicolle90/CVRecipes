#### Method:

1. Add the flour, turmeric, curry powder, sugar, baking powder, salt and butter in a bowl and rub in the butter. Add small increments of 3-4 tbsp cold dairy free milk or water and mix and knead until all collected*. tip: add a sprinkle of flour if the dough is too sticky.*
2. Roll into a ball and cover, place in the fridge to chill for 30 mins.
3. Season plant based meat with black pepper, salt and all purpose seasoning.
4. Add virgin olive oil to a pot on low heat along with chopped carrots, onions, garlic, scotch bonnet pepper (optional), green onions and thyme. Simmer until soft.
5. Turn heat to medium-high, add the plant based mince to the pot and mix everything together. Make sure to break down the mince as you stir so there are no lumps. 
6. Add ketchup, soy sauce and panko bread crumbs, taste and add more flavour if needed.
7. Cover and allow to simmer over low heat for a 15 - 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then set aside.*tip: if the mince is too dry add a few tablespoons of hot water and mix.*
8. Remove dough from the fridge, dust a clean surface with flour and roll dough out. Add cold grated butter and vegetable fat to dough, fold and roll out. Dust extra flour on rolling pin if the dough is sticking to it.
9. Roll the dough out and cut out into a large circular discs using a small saucer, with the pastry about ½cm thick.
10. Preheat oven to 190 degrees.
11. Put 2 tablespoon of the filling on one side of the pastry, leaving about 1cm around the edge. Fold the other half of the pastry over the filled half and press the edges together, using a fork to seal the edges. Use a fork to lightly pierce the patties 2-3 times to allow air to be released.
12. Brush the patties with melted coconut oil, place on a baking tray lined with baking paper and cook in the oven for 25 - 30 mins, or until golden. Cool for 10 minutes.
